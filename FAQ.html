	<br><strong>Who can join MM Virtual Community?</strong><br>Virtual Community is a place for all Students and other staff members of the university. &nbsp;

	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>If a member of the community is facing a problem that he/she is not able to find a flat or PG on rent so he/she<br>could post the same on the

	provide a<br>platform for them to post/publish their advertisement for free.<br><br>If a member has lost his valuable item then he/she can ask the other members if 
	they found it. Similarly, if someone has found any valuable item inside the organizational premises then he/she can return it to the original owner through posting 
	it on the community.&nbsp; It will provide an authenticated environment for this. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
