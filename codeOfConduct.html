This is online platform, where the student of MMDU, Proffessor/Teacher sand other staff of MMDU can interact together. Theis community is totally built ona 
			&nbsp;common problems, a common intrest where any one share anythings of his intrest. Virtual contributors and users are committed to providing a friendly, safe and 
			welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, 
			nationality, race, age, religion, or similar personal characteristics.<br><br>The first goal of the Code of Conduct is to specify a baseline standard of behavior so that 
			people with different social values and communication styles can talk about and on MMVC effectively, productively, and respectfully.<br><br>The second goal is to provide a 
			mechanism for resolving conflicts in the community when they arise.<br><br>The third goal of the Code of Conduct is to make our community welcoming to people from different 
			backgrounds. Diversity is critical to the project; for MMVC to be successful, it needs contributors and users from all backgrounds.<br><br><strong>MMVC Value</strong>These 
			are the values to which people in the MMVC community (“MMVC ”) should aspire.<br>1. Be friendly and welcoming<br>2. Be PatientRemember that people have varying communication 
			styles and that not everyone is using their native language. (Meaning and tone can be lost in translation.)<br><br>3. Be thoughtfulRemember that sometimes it is best to 
			refrain entirely from commenting.<br>Productive communication requires effort. Think about how your words will be interpreted.<br>4.&nbsp;Be charitable<br>Interpret the 
			arguments of others in good faith, do not seek to disagree.<br>When we do disagree, try to understand why.<br><br>5.&nbsp;Avoid destructive behavior:<br>Derailing: stay on topic; 
			if you want to talk about something else, start a new conversation<br>Unconstructive criticism: don't merely decry the current state of affairs; offer—or at least 
			solicit—suggestions as to how things may be improved.<br>Snarking (pithy, unproductive, sniping comments)<br>Discussing potentially offensive or sensitive 
			issues; this all too often leads to unnecessary conflict.<br>Microaggressions: brief and commonplace verbal, behavioral and environmental indignities that communicate 
			hostile, derogatory or negative slights and insults to a person or group.<br><br>People are complicated. You should expect to be misunderstood and to misunderstand others; when this inevitably 
			occurs, resist the urge to be defensive or assign blame. Try not to take offense where no offense was intended. Give people the benefit of the doubt. Even if the intent was to provoke, do not rise to it. 
			It is the responsibility of&nbsp;<em>all parties</em>&nbsp;to de-escalate conflict when it arises.<br><br><strong>Code of Conduct</strong><br>Our Pledge<br>In the interest of fostering an open and 
			welcoming environment, we as users, contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability,

Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.<br><br>This Code of Conduct also applies outside the project spaces when the MMVC team has a reasonable belief that an individual’s behavior may have a negative impact on the project or its community.<br><br>What happens when someone breaks the COC?<br>In cases when someone breaks MMVC code of conduct, they will receive a warning message from the Community Manager or a moderator and will face some consequences.<br><br><strong>The first warning</strong>&nbsp;includes a direct message from the CM or a moderator and the comment/reply/post/ or any other form of contribution present online will be removed immediately.
